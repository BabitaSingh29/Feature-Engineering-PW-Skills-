    "The filter method involves computing a statistical metric for each feature, such as correlation, mutual information, or chi-squared test, that reflects the strength of the relationship between the feature and the target variable. Then, the features are ranked based on this metric, and a subset of the highest-ranking features is selected as the final feature set."

    "The Wrapper method is a feature selection technique that differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates the performance of the machine learning algorithm on different subsets of features. In the Wrapper method, the algorithm iteratively selects a subset of features, trains a model using only those features, and evaluates its performance. The process is repeated for different subsets of features, and the best subset of features is selected based on the performance metric. The Wrapper method takes into account the interaction between features and can select a subset of features that is optimal for the specific machine learning algorithm and the given task. However, it is computationally more expensive than the Filter method and may suffer from overfitting on small datasets."

    "Some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods include Lasso regression, Ridge regression, Elastic Net regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosted Trees. Lasso and Ridge regression are linear models that apply a regularization penalty to the model coefficients, which forces some coefficients to be zero and results in feature selection. Elastic Net is a combination of Lasso and Ridge regression that balances between L1 and L2 regularization. Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosted Trees are tree-based models that recursively split the dataset based on the features that provide the most information gain. These models can perform feature selection by selecting the most important features in the tree-building process. Embedded feature selection techniques are powerful because they can select features that are specific to the model and the task, leading to better model performance and generalization."
