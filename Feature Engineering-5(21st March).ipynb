    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both methods used to transform categorical data into numerical data for machine learning models. However, the key difference between them is the nature of the categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding is used when the categorical variable has a clear order or hierarchy. For example, if we have a variable called \"education level\" with categories \"high school\", \"college\", and \"graduate school\", we can assign numeric values in ascending order, such as 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding, on the other hand, is used when the categorical variable has no inherent order. In this case, each category is assigned a unique numeric value, such as assigning \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\" to 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing between the two methods, it is important to consider the nature of the variable and the assumptions of the machine learning model being used. For example, if we are building a linear regression model, ordinal encoding may be more appropriate as it preserves the order of the categories, while label encoding may be suitable for tree-based models that do not require such assumptions."

This encoding replaces the categories with ordinal numbers that are determined by the mean of the target variable for each category.
