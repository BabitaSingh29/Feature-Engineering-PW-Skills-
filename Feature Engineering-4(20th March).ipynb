    "Data encoding refers to the process of transforming data from one format to another for various purposes such as storage, transmission, or processing. In data science, data encoding is a critical technique used to convert categorical data into numerical data to enable analysis and modeling. By encoding categorical variables, data scientists can derive meaningful insights from data, build accurate predictive models, and make data-driven decisions. Additionally, encoding can also be used to compress data, which reduces storage requirements and improves processing efficiency, making it easier to work with large datasets."

It assigns a unique number to each category, but the numbers do not have any inherent order or hierarchy.

This can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve customer experience."

If the categorical data has a low cardinality, i.e., a small number of categories, we can use one-hot encoding. However, with 5 unique values, one-hot encoding might not be the most efficient choice, as it would create 5 new columns, which could cause data sparsity and computational overhead. In this case, nominal encoding would be a more appropriate choice as it assigns a unique number to each category, thereby reducing the number of columns needed to represent the data.
